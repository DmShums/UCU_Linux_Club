# About us

We are just a bunch of students from Ukrainian Catholic University passionate about
computing! We like to know how our system works under the hood, both because we
want to use all the resources we have at our disposal - the computing power,
useful abstractions and tools; and because we like to tinker with stuff. 
And what's even better than knowing how to do magical things with your computer? 
Letting others know they can do it too, which is why we are organizing this club - 
an informal course for Ukrainian computer science students taught by students! 

We are also huge supporters of the philosophy of open source and free software, 
which is why we've chosen to call our club after the Linux operating system 
(and why we're going to use it throughout our lectures),
and why we've decided to make this course public.

You can join us live - we have lectures each **Wednesday 16:30 Kyiv time**, or watch 
our previous recorded lectures and read through lecture notes.

# Pre-requirements:

- An *OK* English level. If you've gotten this far, you're good to go! 
- Computer with an Internet connection.
- If you want to follow our later lectures, you need to have an Arch Linux-based system installed - see a [manual on how to set one up yourself](./articles/manual).
- Desire to learn!

# Homework

Yeah, we don't like homework either, but practicing something yourself
is the best way to learn a new topic! Most of our lectures will provide
some kind of a home task for you to complete - both to remind yourself
what the lecture was about and to learn on your own. 

You don't need to submit these homeworks, but if you want our feedback on 
them to learn even more, here are a few simple steps for you to follow:

* Fork [our repository](https://github.com/ucu-cs/UCU_Linux_Club)
* Watch the respective lecture on the topic
* Work on this week's homework in `./homework`
* Submit a pull request into our original repository
* Wait for us to check your homework and give you feedback
* Done, congrats!
