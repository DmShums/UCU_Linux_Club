If you want to know why we require you to have an Arch Linux-based system installed, read below. You can also skip right to our pages on [Manjaro installation](@/articles/manjaro-manual.md) and [Arch installation](@/articles/arch-manual/index.md).

*(Some of the terms below might be relatively new, we've emphasized them with italics, and we encourage you to read more about them! We will explain much more during the club itself, so don't fret)*

1. What's Linux?

    Linux is a popular *operating system* (Windows or MacOS are some of the other OSs you might have heard about). 

1. Why Linux?

    Linux is *open-source*: all of its code is not only freely available for you to use and compile, but everyone is allowed to modify the source code and submit their changes! Linux allows for easy extension and customization, and is irreplaceable for developers that need any reasonable level of control over their system.

    Windows and MacOS are not open-source, and are not at all easy to obtain and modify! They are mostly targeted at mass-market users and not experienced developers.

    Over the course of the year you will gain familiarity with your operating system and will, little by little, understand what's actually happening under the hood of your computer, and be able to set it up just the way you want (and fix it, too)!

1. Why did we choose Arch Linux?

    Linux is the *kernel* of the operating system (the kernel includes the most important things that are required for your computer to be able to boot and function correctly), but most people use various Linux *distributions*  that are targeted at actual users: they also include some pre-installed software, graphical interfaces, package managers etc.

    Arch Linux is one of the most popular Linux distributions that tries to **Keep It Simple**. It's extremely lightweight and flexible, and we believe that it allows for a great level of exposure to all the underlying operating system mechanisms and interfaces. It can be fairly difficult to install it the first time around though, so you might prefer Manjaro Linux - another distribution that is based on Arch.

1. What's the difference between Manjaro and Arch?

    Manjaro comes with more pre-installed software and a graphical interface of your choosing (base Arch Linux is just a dark command line!), and will be easier to use if this is your first experience with Linux. Manjaro is based on Arch Linux, meaning it still has its package manager system, a minimal setup and easy configuration.

    There are downsides, of course, a minimal Manjaro installation will require about 30Gb of disk space (Arch takes up around 7Gb) and might include some software you do not actually need. You will also not be able to see the naked and real process of the installation, instead prompted with simple questions on a GUI.

If this is your first time with Linux, we recommend you proceed to our [Manjaro installation guide](@/articles/manjaro-manual.md). If you already have some experience with it, or want to be challenged, see our [Arch installation guide](@/articles/arch-manual/index.md).
