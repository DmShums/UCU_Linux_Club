## Week 5 RegEx Homework

### You should use this doc as a template, fork the repository, fill in the answers, push changes to your repo, create pull request and add Lesi-N as a reviewer.

### Try and complete the challenges without consulting external sources; if you get stuck, move on and come back to it later. If you're still having difficulties, use the hints and try to understand them. Good luck!
